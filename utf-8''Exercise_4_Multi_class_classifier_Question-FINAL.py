  # You will need to write code that will read the file passed
  # into this function. The first line contains the column headers
  # so you should ignore it
  # Each successive line contians 785 comma separated values between 0 and 255
  # The first value is the label
  # The rest are the pixel values for that picture
  # The function will return 2 np.array types. One with all the labels
  # One with all the images
  #
  # Tips: 
  # If you read a full line (as 'row') then row[0] has the label
  # and row[1:785] has the 784 pixel values
  # Take a look at np.array_split to turn the 784 pixels into 28x28
  # You are reading in strings, but need the values to be floats
  # Check out np.array().astype for a conversion
